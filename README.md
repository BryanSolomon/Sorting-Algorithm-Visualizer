# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
A react application that simulates different sorting algorithms on randomly generated arrays. 

## Setup
To use the web app, make sure you have the latest version of Nodejs installed.
In your terminal or command propt, make sure you are in the project's directory.
Run command
```console
npm start
```

### *Bugs*
*If another sorting button is pushed while sorting is in progress, red markers indicating a new sorting process show at the indexes of the array that would have been sorted. However, it does not actually sort array again.*
